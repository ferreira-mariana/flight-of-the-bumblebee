# Flight of the bumblebee

A game inspired by Daniel Shiffman class about [Perlin Noise](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/the-nature-of-code-2/noc/perlin/graphing-1d-perlin-noise) in The Nature of Code.

His video about graphing Perlin noise reminded me of the movement of bees, which in turn reminded me of the song _Flight of the Bumblebee_ by Rimsky-Korsakov. So I put it all together and made this little game.
