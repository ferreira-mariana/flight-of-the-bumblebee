# Flight of the bumblebee

A game inspired by Daniel Shiffman class on [Perlin Noise](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/the-nature-of-code-2/noc/perlin/graphing-1d-perlin-noise) in The Nature of Code.

In the class, when [@shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) said 'wandering bee buzzing behavior', I remembered the song _Flight of the Bumblebee_ by Rimsky-Korsakov that evokes the movement of a bee and fits perfectly with the behavior of Perlin Noise. I immediately paused the video and started creating this [animation](https://editor.p5js.org/ferreira-mariana/full/Yk699UUQZ) of a bee flying with this song on the background, then I submitted to [The Coding Train Passenger Showcase](https://thecodingtrain.com/showcase).

Later, I turned it into a little game. [Click here to play!](https://ferreira-mariana.github.io/flight-of-the-bumblebee/)
